# WhatsApp Communication Pattern Analysis: A Case Study of Daily Digital Interaction

## Introduction

In our increasingly digital world, instant messaging has become the primary medium for maintaining close personal relationships. This analysis examines a comprehensive dataset derived from a WhatsApp chat history between two participants, spanning approximately five months and encompassing over 62,000 messages. This rich dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore patterns in digital communication and understand how messaging platforms facilitate daily interactions.

The analysis focuses on several key aspects of digital communication:

1. **Temporal Communication Patterns**: By analyzing hourly message distribution, we aim to uncover when participants are most active in their communication, potentially revealing natural rhythms in their daily digital interaction.

2. **Emotional Expression Through Emojis**: Modern communication relies heavily on emoji usage to convey emotion and context. We'll examine how both participants utilize these digital expressions and what this reveals about their communication styles.

3. **Topic Clustering**: Through text cluster analysis, we'll identify primary conversation themes and patterns, offering insights into the breadth and focus of daily discussions.

4. **Sentiment Patterns**: By applying sentiment analysis, we'll explore the emotional undertones of messages throughout different times and contexts, providing a deeper understanding of communication dynamics.

5. **Feature Relationships**: Through relational analysis of various message characteristics, we'll investigate how different aspects of communication interconnect and influence each other.

This comprehensive analysis not only provides insights into modern communication patterns but also demonstrates the application of various data visualization techniques to understand human interaction in the digital age. Each visualization in this report has been carefully crafted to tell a specific story about different aspects of digital communication, following established principles of effective data visualization.

The following sections will present each analysis in detail, accompanied by visualizations and discussions of the patterns and insights discovered. Through this exploration, we aim to shed light on how digital communication tools shape and reflect our daily interactions.

I have also taken it upon myself to add a config handler to reduce hardcoding across the project
